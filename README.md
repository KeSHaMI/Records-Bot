#Records-Bot

First bot I've ever made 

I "invented"(I'm not proud of this) caching in bots. Overall this decision is ok because bot is CRM integrated and it doesn't need to store results for a long time.

Also here I have calender realization(there's no ready decisions I like), hopefully someone find my solutions usefull
